We use kgpu modules in linux kernel 2.6.39.4 of ubuntu 10.10(64-Bit).
Graphics: nVidia Quadro 600(Memory: 1G) and  CUDA Toolkit 4.0.
To build kernel 2.6.39.4, you just need to make a note of the following option: 
	File systems->Miscellaneous filesystems->eCrypt filesystem layer support(M)

Usage:

cd bak_kgpu
make
cd build

cp ecryptfs.ko /lib/moduled/$(shell uname -r)/kernel/fs/ecryptfs/
sudo ./runkgpu

mkdir testdir #Create testdir in anywhere to test ecrypt file, but don't in bak_kgpu
sudo mount -t ecryptfs testdir testdir
.....   #To operate ecryptfs, you can learn it from net.
.....

when you end, you should do the following thing:

sudo rmmod ecryptfs
cd bak_kgpu/build
audo ./stopkgpu
