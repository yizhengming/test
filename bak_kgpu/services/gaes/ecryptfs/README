Modified eCryptfs for Linux using GPU-AES


This is a demo to show the performance gain by using GPU accelerated
AES functions inside the kernel, with the help of KGPU.

The performance optimization only aims at large trunk of data reading/
writing or multiple parallel reads/writes. Small sized(typically smaller
than 8KB or 16KB) fs ops can not be sped up. Since the fs is called
eCryptfs, where e means 'enterprise', large trunked reads/writes
are expected to be very often and more frequent than small ones.

The eCryptfs is an encrypted filesystem in Linux kernel.
